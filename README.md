# Corner-and-Automatic-Threshold-Detection
**Project Title: Scoring Function and Automatic Threshold Detection Analysis**

**Description:**

The main aim of this assignment is to analyze the interaction between various scoring functions (corner detections) and automatic threshold detection. Specifically, scoring functions, such as corner detections, are applied to the image, and then the resulting gradient magnitudes are subjected to automatic threshold detection. The following components are to be implemented:

1. **Corner Detection**:
   - **Harris**: Implement the Harris corner detection algorithm to identify corners in the image.
   - **SUSAN**: Implement the SUSAN corner detection algorithm for corner detection.

2. **Automatic Threshold Detection**:
   - **Calculate Convex Hull**: Develop a method to calculate the convex hull of the gradient magnitudes obtained from the corner detection process.

**Requirements:**

- Implement the Harris and SUSAN corner detection algorithms to identify corners in the image effectively.
- Develop functions to calculate gradient magnitudes and apply automatic threshold detection techniques.
- Implement the calculation of the convex hull of the gradient magnitudes for automatic threshold detection.
- Provide clear documentation and comments for code readability and understanding.
- Test the implemented components thoroughly to ensure correctness and effectiveness.
- Consider handling edge cases and exceptional scenarios gracefully.

**Expected Output:**

- Implementation details of each corner detection algorithm with explanations.
- Functionality to calculate gradient magnitudes and perform automatic threshold detection.
- Visual representations (e.g., images, plots) demonstrating the effectiveness of corner detection and thresholding techniques.
- Evaluation of the interaction between different scoring functions and automatic threshold detection methods.
- Discussion on the strengths and limitations of each corner detection algorithm and thresholding technique.

**Additional Notes:**

- Experiment with different parameters and configurations for corner detection and thresholding to observe their effects on the results.
- Encourage collaboration and contributions from others interested in image processing and computer vision.
- Explore potential applications and scenarios where these corner detection and automatic thresholding techniques can be applied, such as object recognition, feature extraction, or image segmentation.
